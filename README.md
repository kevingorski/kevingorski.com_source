[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

This builds [kevingorski.github.com](http://github.com/kevingorski/kevingorski.github.com) / [kevingorski.com](http://kevingorski.com).

The interesting bits are probably all in [Gruntfile.js](Gruntfile.js), where I moved my [Wintersmith](http://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) + [Grunt.js](http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)-based build to just Grunt as 0.2 turned into 0.4. It could still use some attention, but it's working so far.

Here I am again, trying to restart my writing habit. Most recently I've [publicly written about](http://nodenerd.net) a specific [software technology](http://nodejs.org), but here I want to cover a wider array of topics. I'll still cover code and software architecture, but also typography and more abstract writing like essays and opinion pieces.

In addition to quality content, I want this site to stand as a good example of responsive site design and type setting. I've been entertaining the idea of creating a style for each article, but for now I think it's best if I focus on the words and the code.

The first proper article I'll be writing up will be about one of my side projects called [Can You Read It Now?](http://canyoureaditnow.com). Let's hope it will be a little more lively than this!

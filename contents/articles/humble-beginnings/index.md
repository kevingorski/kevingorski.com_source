Here I am again, trying to restart my writing habit. Most recently I've [publicly written about Node.js](http://nodenerd.net), but here I want to cover a wider array of topics. I'll still cover code, but also typography and more abstract writing like essays.

In addition to quality content, I want this site to stand as a good example of responsive site design and type setting. This is the most focused I've been on either of these goals, but I am admittedly still a beginner, so please let me know if anything looks out of place.

The first proper article I'll share here will be about one of my side projects called [Can You Read It Now?](http://canyoureaditnow.com) Until next time!
